## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

The screenshots of this project can be found in the "images" folder.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- CSS media queries
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

There is more than one way of adding an image to your projects. 
Using the HTML image tag is optional. You can use the CSS property "Background-image" to get the image displayed easier.

### Continued development

I want to continue refining my proficiency on CSS grid for more complex projects given its importance.

### Useful resources

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp: I found w3Schools to be a reliable reference guide for all things web development. In this case,  a product review card.
